# How You Can Help
At this time, funding our budget is our biggest constraint. You can help OAK by donating directly to our operations budget for 2021. Be sure to specify the location that you wish to donate to (OAK)!

## **[Donate](https://www.monasticacademy.com/donate/)**

You can also:
* Mail a check to OAK, 13 Windcrest Lane, South San Francisco, CA 94080
* [Email us](mailto:oak@monasticacademy.com) to discuss making an alternate form of donation (e.g. a pledge, or stock donation, or property).

Finally, if you know someone who would like to participate in or support our programs, please share this post with them and tell them about [our mailing list](http://eepurl.com/dnvpi1).
